This is a beginner level challenge that includes only the usage of html and css.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a good practice to begin taking the front-end Mentor Challenges.

However I had a good practice on how to link my VS code with github repositories and how to create and edit README files, which is something I was not very familiar with.

### Continued development

My next step for this challenge is to enable a live page example by deploying it with github pages, netlify or any other hosting services platform.
